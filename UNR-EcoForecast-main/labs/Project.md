Ultimately the goal of learning forecasting tools is to be able to apply it in your own research, so now is your chance!


### Topic ###
Any ecological or environmental system with enough data.

The project needs to include some form of near-term spatial or temporal forecasting, and have data that can be used to test the forecast at that spatial and temporal scale. For example forecasting where a species occurs now based on occurrence data would be appropriate because existing occurrence data can be withheld to test the forecast. Forecasting where a species will occur in 100 years with climate change is not an appropriate topic for this project as it is impossible to test this forecast at this time horizon. 

Talk with Bob about the specifics of your topic before the deadline! (March 9)

### Details ###
All projects should include model development and test the model with new or withheld data data

I want this project to be as useful as possible to your research, so you are not required to use R or Stan to develop your model. However, if you use another programming language I may not be able to help you. Also, if you use a preexisting package to fit your model you must understand what it is doing well enough to explain it to me and the class, simply listing the package name is not enough details. All forecasts should quantify at least some measure of uncertainty (ies) and identify its sources (parameter uncertainty vs process uncertainty). 

Every student will turn in a 5 pg. (or less) writeup including 

1) Background about the system and why forecasting would be useful in this system.

2) Model development and testing. How did you build you model? What does the model look like (equations)? Why did you choose the approach you took? How well did your forecast fit new data? How was it assessed? Did you test multiple models (not required but could be interesting)? How much uncertainty is there? What is the relative importance of parameter vs process uncertainty? -----Please provide figures of your model forecasts and tests. Figure are almost always better than words. 

3) What you learned?

4) Opportunities for improvement and future directions.

Every student will also give a ~10 min in class presentation summerizing the above topics

Finally, talk to me while you are working on your project!! Show me how it's going, ask me and your neighbor what we think of your model and your figures. I  want to know what you did long before I read your final project report.
