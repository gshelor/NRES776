*Please turn in your Stan and R code along with a document with answers to the following to Bob*



1) Develop a forecast for the mean NDVI for the last 10 months, assuming that the rainfall is known. Include a plot of the forecast timeseries with the mean (i.e. the mean of the mean NDVI) and 95% credible intervals for the mean as well as the observed data

2) How does the SD of the predicted mean change as we forecast forward in time? Does uncertainty become larger or smaller or stay the same?

3) Why is it important to account for covariance in parameter error? Do you think not including covariance would increase or decrease our predicted uncertainty in this example?
